# ALX Listing App

## Project Description
The ALX Listing App project is a foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone sets up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The goal is to establish a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.

## Project Structure
- `components/`: Contains all reusable React components.
  - `common/`: Houses fundamental, project-wide components like `Button` and `Card`.
- `interfaces/`: Defines all TypeScript interfaces for type safety.
- `constants/`: Stores reusable data and configuration constants.
- `public/assets/`: Holds static assets such as images and SVGs.
